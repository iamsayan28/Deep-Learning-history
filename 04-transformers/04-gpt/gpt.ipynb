    "### understanding generative pre-trained transformer (gpt) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the generative pre-trained transformer (gpt) family of models, introduced by openai, represents a significant advancement in language modeling and natural language processing. these models employ a decoder-only transformer architecture and utilize an autoregressive approach to text generation. the evolution from gpt-1 through subsequent versions has demonstrated remarkable scaling properties, with each iteration showing significant improvements in performance and capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "gpt models utilize a decoder-only transformer architecture, which differs from encoder-decoder models like t5. the architecture consists of multiple transformer blocks stacked upon each other, with each block containing self-attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks. the model processes text as a sequence of tokens and predicts the next token based on all previous tokens in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> attention mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "gpt implements a masked self-attention mechanism where each token can only attend to its previous tokens and itself. this causality constraint is crucial for the autoregressive nature of the model. the attention mechanism computes queries, keys, and values for each token and uses scaled dot-product attention to weight the importance of different tokens in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the pre-training of gpt models follows an autoregressive language modeling objective. the model learns to predict the next token in a sequence given all previous tokens. this unsupervised learning approach allows the model to learn from vast amounts of text data without requiring labeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> tokenization\n",
    "\n",
    "gpt models use byte-pair encoding (bpe) tokenization, which breaks down text into subword units. this approach provides a balance between character-level and word-level tokenization, allowing the model to handle both common and rare words effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "the model uses learned position embeddings to maintain awareness of token positions in the sequence. these embeddings are added to the token embeddings before being processed by the transformer layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "gpt models demonstrate impressive scaling properties, with performance improving predictably with model size. key scaling factors include:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "during text generation, the model employs various decoding strategies such as greedy decoding, beam search, or sampling with temperature control. these strategies help balance between output quality and diversity.\n",
    "\n",
    "the success of gpt models has significantly influenced the direction of nlp research and applications, demonstrating the potential of large-scale language models trained on vast amounts of text data. their ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text has opened new possibilities in various domains, from creative writing to technical documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> model size\n",
    "\n",
    "increasing the number of parameters by expanding model depth and width helps in performance. gpt-2 ranges from 117 million to 1.5 billion parameters across its variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "> dataset size\n",
    "\n",
    " gpt-2 was trained on a diverse dataset of 8 million web pages selected for quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> context window\n",
    "\n",
    "gpt-2 processes sequences of up to 1024 tokens, allowing it to maintain longer-range dependencies than previous models. this expanded context window enables more coherent generation of long passages.\n",
