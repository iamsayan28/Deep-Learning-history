    "> **What is a loss fucntion ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- while training the model the loss fucntion is used to calculate the mismatch between actual vlaues and predicted values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- it requires to parameters to calulate it Y_hat(predicted) and y(actual value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- the goal is to find paramaters values that minimize the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Maximum Likelihood**\n",
    "\n",
    "-  here we compute the distribution over a outputs.(y_hat)\n",
    "\n",
    "- instead of guessing single outcomes the model predicts a range of possible outcomes and how likely each one is.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ex. if we guess someone's height it 6ft but we are guessing so it might be less or more. So we represent this using bell curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - to plot this we need mean and variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Maximum Likelihood Criterion**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maximum Likeihood Estimation : we want to get the right of values for our model's parameter in order to reduce the gap between our prediceted output and actual outputs.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Model Prediction (Pr(y_i | x_i, φ)):**\n",
    "   - Pr(y_i | x_i, φ) represents the probability that our model predicts the actual outcome (y_i) given the input data (x_i) and the model parameters (φ).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Think of this as the model saying, \"Based on my current parameters, there's an X% chance that this specific input (x_i) will result in this specific output (y_i).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Product of Probabilities:**\n",
    "   - ∏(i=1 to n) means we multiply these probabilities together for all the data points (from 1 to n).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - This gives us a combined probability that shows how likely it is that all our predictions match the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Maximizing the Combined Probability:**\n",
    "   - argmax_φ means we want to find the specific parameters (φ) that make this combined probability as large as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - inshort, we're adjusting our model's paramters to [maximize] the chances that it predicts the actual outcomes correctly.\n",
